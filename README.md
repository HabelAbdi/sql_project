# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
-the project is to get a few files (CSV) and to sift through them to then understand it a little while getting into the mindset of what a data scientist thinks like to then come out with beneficial information.  project goals are to be able to read data more efficiently, along with being able to point out the flaws and the issues data might have before even having the ability to clean or scrape through it. 

## Process
Step 1: Import and Explore Data
Description: Begin by importing the CSV files into a data analysis tool (like Python with pandas or any other preferred tool). Perform initial data exploration tasks such as displaying the first few rows, checking data types, identifying columns, and understanding the overall structure of the data. This step helps in gaining a preliminary understanding of the data and its format. 


step 2: Data Quality Assessment
Description: Conduct a thorough data quality assessment to identify issues and flaws in the data. This includes checking for missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and any unexpected patterns. Document these issues along with potential reasons for their occurrence. Understanding data flaws is essential for planning data cleaning and preprocessing steps)

## Results
- the data had a few empty columns regarding a company and its website presence along with users spending long periods of time on websites specifically selecting certain aspects of home decor or homebuying based in different countries.
- was able to find out which countries have the most time spent on certain parts of the websites for users and what products they ended up buying throughout certain cities along with the volume of quantities.
  
## Challenges 
- some of the columns have no context and it's challenging to determine the actual appropriate data type, along with what the set information is describing before manipulating it to do other things to find out other pieces of information.
- the city column doesn't line up with some of the countries, meaning that some cities aren't the right cities for their connected country. 
**## Future Goals
- make more sense of the data
- clean up more of the data types
- fill in more of the cells
- cross reference the cities that might need to be filled connected to their respected countries.
