What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.


Data Quality: Inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data can lead to incorrect conclusions. The columns are either completely empty or have little to no information regarding what the picture is showing. 

Managing Assumptions: assumptions made during analysis can be very hard to moderate as some of the columns have little to no context regarding the information being presented except its column name. Incorrect assumptions can lead to incorrect interpretations of the data.

Scope Creep: Be clear about the project scope. Expanding the scope without proper planning can lead to delays and resource constraints.

Communication: Inadequate communication of findings or misinterpretation of results can lead to incorrect actions being taken. for example, not being able to find the top sales or products in certain cities would cause a misdirection in resources at a company if this data was being used, as some of the cities are not there but some are not even the correct ones linked to their country. 

Resource Limitations: Limited time and expertise can impact the depth and quality of the analysis.
